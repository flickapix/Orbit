# Jigsaw Framework

**Version**: 1.0

A starting point and framework used by me (aka Fringe Development) with a focus on creating customized WordPress themes. Jigsaw is built to help in putting together solid, responsive, websites with an emphasis on building bespoke WordPress themes (or a static site if you want), utilizing all my favorite other frameworks. 

Jigsaw has been put together to save me development time implementing my current, favorite approach towards building sites.

This framework contains various bits shared from the best developers and frameworks around the web including: 

* [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://frn.gd/zBjqfs)
* [HTML5 Boilerplate Mobile](http://html5boilerplate.com/mobile)
* [320 and Up](http://frn.gd/ywAwhQ)
* [Roots](http://www.rootstheme.com/)

**Cobbled together by:**:

* Ryan Urban ( [@fringewebdev](http://twitter.com/fringewebdev) / [fringewebdevelopment.com](http://fringewebdevelopment.com/) )

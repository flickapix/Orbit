# Orbit Framework

**Version**: 1.0

Orbit is a web development framework to assist you in getting your WordPress (or a static) site setup, configured, and into orbit quickly so you can focus your development time on building your project.

Orbit is a framework with a focus on creating customized WordPress sites, quickly, and is also built to help in putting together solid, responsive, sites utilizing all my favorite frameworks. 

Orbit has been put together to save me development time implementing my current, favorite approach towards building sites.

This framework contains various bits shared from the best developers and frameworks around the web including: 

* [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://frn.gd/zBjqfs)
* [HTML5 Boilerplate Mobile](http://html5boilerplate.com/mobile)

* [Roots](http://www.rootstheme.com/)

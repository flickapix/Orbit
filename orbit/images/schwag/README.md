# Everybody loves schwag

With the rise of the tablets and smartphones, I think it's a nice touch to provide customized startup screens and icons for your site. When done well it also adds an extension of your brand and can provide a nice first touch for your users.

I have included a Photoshop file (schwag-templates.psd) to act as a template for the various sizes required for icons and startups screens (including for the retina displays).

You'll also find a sample of the various, currently recommended sizes for icons and startup screens in the schwag folder.

These are implemented and called in our header.php file, and you can look there for more details on what devices these various images are applicable to.
